                        <p>Monero is an open source community project. Meaning that there is no company who runs it and there is no CEO who hires people. Everything is built by volunteers or community-funded contributors who dedicate their time to the project. There are many ways to contribute:</p>
                        <p>Translations. It's easy and anybody speaking a language beside English can help. Translations happen mostly on <a href="https://translate.getmonero.org/">Weblate</a>.</p>
                        <p>Contact a Workgroup. Almost everything in Monero is managed by workgroups, which are groups of contributors (often lead by a coordinator) working on some specific aspect of the development. Some examples are: the localization workgroup (translations), the community workgroup, the GUI workgroup, the Outreach workgroup and so on. Workgroups are mostly independent and have their own structure. Contact the workgroup that interests you and ask how you can help. For a list of contacts see the <a href="../../community/hangouts/index.html">Hangouts</a>.</p>
                        <p>Do what you can do best. Are you a designer? Create Monero related images and spread them around. Are you a writer? Write about Monero. The only limit is your imagination. Find what you like to do and do it for Monero!</p>
                        <p>The Outreach workgroup wrote a useful article to help newcomers: <a href="https://www.monerooutreach.org/stories/getting-started-helping-monero.html">Getting started with Monero</a>.</p>

                        <p>You can buy Monero from an exchange or from an individual. Exchanges are the most common way to buy Monero; there are compliant exchanges in most jurisdictions. Some wallets include functionality to easily buy Monero with fiat or other cryptocurrencies. Alternatively, you can try mining Monero to get coins from the <a class="info-tooltip" data-tooltip="a container of transactions, a sequence of which forms a blockchain" href="../../resources/moneropedia/block.html">block</a> reward.</p>
                        <p>In past, you needed Bitcoin to buy Monero, but that's not the case anymore. You can directly trade Monero for national currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, etc) or other cryptocurrencies on many exchanges. Some require KYC (proof of identification); others do not, like decentralized exchanges. On this website is available a list of exchanges where it's possible to buy/sell Monero (XMR): <a href="../../community/merchants/index.html#exchanges">Merchants &amp; Exchanges</a>.</p>

                    <div class="tab-answer">
                        <p>Monero is not based on Bitcoin. It is based on the CryptoNote protocol. Bitcoin is a completely transparent system, where people can see exactly how much money is being sent from one user to another. Monero hides this information to protect user privacy in all transactions. It also has a dynamic <a class="info-tooltip" data-tooltip="a container of transactions, a sequence of which forms a blockchain" href="../../resources/moneropedia/block.html">block</a> size and dynamic fees, an ASIC-resistant proof of work (<a class="info-tooltip" data-tooltip="ASIC-resistant POW algoritm currently used by Monero" href="../../resources/moneropedia/randomx.html">randomx</a>), and a <a class="info-tooltip" data-tooltip="the block reward at the end of the emission curve" href="../../resources/moneropedia/tail-emission.html">tail emission</a>, among several other changes.</p>

                    <h3><a class="anchor" href="index.html#asic-resistance"></a>What is ASIC resistance? Why is it important?</h3>
                    <div class="tab-answer">
                        <p>ASICs are basically special computers created to do only one job, contrary to normal computers, which are made for general purpose. This characteristic makes ASICs very efficient for <a class="info-tooltip" data-tooltip="the process of cryptographically computing a mathematical proof for a block, containing a number of transactions, which is then added to the blockchain" href="../../resources/moneropedia/mining.html">mining</a>.</p>
                        <p>The problem is that these devices are very expensive and can be afforded by few. This leads to few entities owning a big amount of the hashrate of the network, which is a serious threat to the security of the network itself. For example, if big ASIC operators collude and manage to gain the majority of the hashrate of the network, they could arbitrarily reject transactions.</p>
                        <p>Monero fixes this problem by being ASIC-resistant: it uses an algorithm (<a class="info-tooltip" data-tooltip="ASIC-resistant POW algoritm currently used by Monero" href="../../resources/moneropedia/randomx.html">randomx</a>) that strongly reduces the efficiency of ASICs, making them not profitable to build. Miners can use common consumer hardware, which allows them to compete fairly. The Monero network is currently protected by thousands of miners using 'regular' computers. This results in a network much harder to attack, no miner having significant advantage over other miners (they all use more or less the same hardware).

If two people exchanged a 10 and two 5’s, then no one would lose out. However, let’s suppose that everyone knows the 10 was previously used in a ransomware attack. Is the other person still going to make the trade? Probably not, even if the person with the 10 has no connection with the ransomware. This is a problem, since the receiver of money needs to constantly check the money they are receiving to not end up with tainted coins. Monero is fungible, which means people do not need to go through this effort.</p>

                        <p>After you have downloaded the Monero software (GUI and CLI alike), your antivirus or firewall may flag the executables as malware. Some antiviruses only warn you about the possible menace, others go as far as silently removing your downloaded <a class="info-tooltip" data-tooltip="A wallet stores the information necessary to send and receive Monero" href="../../resources/moneropedia/wallet.html">wallet</a> / <a class="info-tooltip" data-tooltip="Background process which runs and controls a Monero node" href="../../resources/moneropedia/daemon.html">daemon</a>.

Some antiviruses may erroneously consider the miner as dangerous software and act to remove it.</p>
                        <p>The problem is being discussed and solutions are being elaborated. In the meantime, if you get a warning from your antivirus, make sure the software you downloaded is legitimate (see the guides linked below), then add an exception for it in your antivirus, so that it won't get removed or blocked.

                        <p>Monero is an Esperanto word which means 'coin'. Initially Monero was called 'Bitmonero', which translates to 'Bitcoin' in Esperanto. After the community decided to fork from the original maintainer, 'bit' was dropped in favour of simply 'Monero'.</p>

                    <div class="tab-answer">
                        <p>Monero used to have 2 network upgrades (hard forks) a year, but this is not the case anymore. The choice of the biannual hard forks was taken in order to be able to introduce important consensus changes, which added privacy features and network-wide improvements (For example <a class="info-tooltip" data-tooltip="a new kind of range proofs replacing RingCT in transactions to obfuscate the amounts sent" href="../../resources/moneropedia/bulletproofs.html">bulletproofs</a> and CLSAG both required a hard fork) and avoid the ossification of the protocol. Recently, the biannual hard forks included changes to the PoW algorithm, to preserve ASIC-resistance.</p>
                        <p>The dev community and the Core Team agree that the protocol is stable and mature enough and biannual hard forks are not necessary anymore. Furthermore, the ecosystem around Monero has grown exponentially during the years and frequent protocol changes would be increasingly hard to coordinate, could be detrimental to the growth of the ecosystem and to the user experience. Cherry on the top, the new algorithm <a class="info-tooltip" data-tooltip="ASIC-resistant POW algoritm currently used by Monero" href="../../resources/moneropedia/randomx.html">RandomX</a> is ensuring long term ASIC-resistance, so regular changes are not needed anymore. Network upgrades will still be used to add important protocol improvements and consensus changes, but at a lower and less strict frequency (every 9-12 months). The last hard fork was on October 18th 2020.</p>

                        <p>We can also know that transaction amounts are valid even though the value of the inputs that you are spending and the value of the outputs you are sending are encrypted (these are hidden to everyone except the recipient).

                        <p>As long as the encrypted output amounts you create is equal to the sum of the inputs that are being spent (which include an output for the recipient and a change output back to yourself and the unencrypted transaction fee), then you have a legitimate transaction and know no Monero is being created out of thin air. Pedersen commitments mean that the sums can be verified as being equal, but the Monero value of each of the sums and the Monero value of the inputs and outputs individually are undeterminable.</p>

                        <p>For a lightweight wallet, you give your view key to a node, who scans the blockchain and looks for incoming transactions to your account on your behalf. This node will know when you receive money, but it will not know how much you receive, who you received it from, or who you are sending money to. Depending on your wallet software, you may be able to use a node you control to avoid privacy leaks. For more privacy, use a normal wallet, which can be used with your own node.</p>

Importing an external <a class="info-tooltip" data-tooltip="a distributed ledger of all transactions both past and present, without revealing who the funds came from or went to" href="../../resources/moneropedia/blockchain.html">blockchain</a> is very resource intensive and forces you to trust the entity providing you with the blockchain.

It can be local or remote" href="../../resources/moneropedia/node.html">nodes</a> in the network. If you really need to import an external blockchain, you can download one in the 'Downloads' page of this website. Follow the guide below if you are using Windows. If you are a linux user, you can use the tool "monero-blockchain-import", which is included in the archive when you download the GUI or CLI wallets. Start syncing the imported blockchain with this command: "monero-blockchain-import --input-file blockchain.raw".

                        <p>You probably didn't. It's very hard to simply 'lose' your coins, since they are technically nowhere. Your coins 'live' on the blockchain and are linked to your account through a system of public and private keys secured by cryptography. That's why if you don't see your funds, it's probably because of a technical issue.
